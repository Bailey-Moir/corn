## ! HOW TO USE !
# Server
You must enable MySQL but **not apache**. You must use command prompt and enter the command `php -S localhost:8000`. It is cruical that the port is 8000 and not anything else. If the url doesn't start with 'localhost:8000' then the website will not work.

# SQL
Create the database by going to `localhost:8000/reset`. This is also helpful for **testing** as it resets the databse and deletes all of its contents.
